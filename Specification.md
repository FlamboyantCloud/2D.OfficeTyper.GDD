# Specification

Back to [[README]]

## Scope

Small, indie game, made by 3-5 people.
To be released on Windows, Linux and Mac.

## Concept

Typeracer with some office drama and government espionage.
The player is a white-colar worker in an office job at a Ministry/Bureau.

The main job objective is converting hand-written documents to digital format via a computer.

The job also includes secondary tasks, like a telephone or marking some documents as classified, propaganda, etc.

## Setting

The setting is a pseudo(?) cold war(?) central city during the 70s(?).

The player is an employee of the *Bureau of Information(?)*,
which is a goverment organization that controls and classifies most of the State's intelligence. 

The State is at a stalemate with another State in a race for space travel, nuclear power, political control, etc.

Therefore, there needs to be secrecy and proper classification of all the information in tiers(?) based on the contents of each document.

## Story

You start as an employee doing digital copy-pasting and little by little, more rules and mechanics are introduced.

For example, classification becomes more complex and sometimes a document needs to be discarded if it contains potential espionage or reverse propaganda.

If the player does the job well, they climb the bureaucracy's hierarchy and if not, they suffer downgrades, etc.

## Objective

The daily objective is to classify as many documents correctly.

Also, the ones that are not discarded have to be typed.

The player is judged based on their WPM, Accuracy and amount of documents properly classified and typed.


## Duration

Main story should be 4-6 hours.
Completioning should be 8-10 hours.(?) 

## Endings

***Needs shitload of work***

Multiple endings are possible. Some ideas:

- The player properly does their job and gets promoted to head of Bureau.

- The player improperly does their job and becomes a homeless junkie or something.

- The player succees in inside-maning an espionage act, where they destroy their own State and escape to the opposing State.

- The player fails in inside-maning an espionage act, where the coffee-lady poisons them according to the Bureau's orders.
