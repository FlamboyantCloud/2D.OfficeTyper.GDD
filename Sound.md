# Sound

Back to [[README]]

## Music

Main music should be elevator-esque, meaning slightly boring and background-ish.
Nations theme at the start of each day 3-5 secs. (maybe if you are a traitor the theme changes to the other nation)
1 generic eerie theme, 1 game over tune

Idea: Main day-theme should be two --three -- parts (οταν θα γινει noticeable να εχουν περασει μερικες μερες, με δυο parts το περιοριζεις) , where the first part stretches as days pass by, to signify how slow time passes in an office job.

## SFX

Mic: Keyboards, bells, phone
Manager phone should be offkey
Voice fx.: Voice saying jiberrish bitcruhed to hell
