## Music

Main music should be elevator-esque, meaning slightly boring and background-ish.
A short Anthem to start the work day signifying the Brutalistic nature of the ministry (?) 5 sec long.
Some creepy music for when serious events act out, if anyone had a haldorophone that would be so good. hmmmm...

Idea: Main day-theme should be three parts, where the  parts stretch as days pass by, to signify how slow time passes in an office job.

## SFX

I got nothing.
•Mic a typewritter
•Mic old phone ringtones
•Bells, lots of bells that are in key to be coherent with the music and some that signify grave events to be completely off key.
•Chatter in the background (?)

## Will there be voices?
